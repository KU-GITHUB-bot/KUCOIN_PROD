#currency Pair can be automatic, semi and training
# the third argument can be either 'market', 'limit' or 'mix'. If left empty, 'market' is used per default
# 'market'. The order will be executed immediately if the algorithm detects a peak. In this case it is possible, that the real exchange value will not be as good as the expected exchange value. Especially if th investment volumne is large
# 'limit'. The order will be set as a limit order based on the calculated current exchange value of the detected peak. The good part is, that the exchange ratio will be as good as calculated. However, it is possible that not all of the order will be executed when the exchange ratio changes
# to avoid accumulation of limit orders, the limit order of all 'sell' of the curreny of interest will be deleted if a 'buy' dip is detected. Analogous, the remaining 'buy' limit orders will be deleted when a 'sell' peak is detected.	
# 'mix' will create two orders. 50% market and 50% limit
